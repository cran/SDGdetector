Description: A tool for identifying 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and associated 
             169 targets in text, as described in Yingjie Li (2022) 
             <https://github.com/Yingjie4Science/SDGdetector/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf> . 
             It uses natural language processing to transform 
             unstructured text into normalized and structured data suitable for 
             analysis and visualization. It thus enables a unique way to monitor 
             individuals' and organizations' commitments and efforts towards 
             advancing SDGs and targets.
